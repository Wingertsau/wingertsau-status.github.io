I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

I start my morning with a cup of coffee and
[The New York Times][NY Times].

have had success working around this problem by adding a time delay to the "Start" routine in rpimonitor. On my Pi the required delay is about 7 seconds for a boot from power off, and less for a "warm" reboot. I am currently using a 10 second delay to be on the safe side. This is with a clean install of Pi 3b using NOOBS v3.2.0 and the current release of RPi-monitor (2.12-r0). If your hardware runs at a different speed or you are using a different version of the software, you may need to increase the delay.

To add the delay to the startup script, edit rpimonitor

    sudo nano /etc/init.d/rpimonitor
Add the instruction "sleep 10" immediately before the "start" instruction in the case structure at tne end of the program. This will be immediately after line 93 in the current release. After editing, the section should look like this:

    case "$1" in
        start)
            sleep 10
            start
            
Save the edited file and RPi-monitor should start without a problem on reboots and restarts.
